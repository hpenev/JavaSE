//Write a program that enters an integer n and calculates the Fibonacci n-number. The zero number of Fibonacci is 1, the first one is also 1, and each one is the sum of the previous two.
//Hint:
//• At n <2, print 1.
//• Start from f0 = 1 and f1 = 1 and in the loop you sum up the last two numbers. Record the last two numbers after each step in f0 and f1.
